# ai-web-scraper

# Overview
This project is an AI-powered web scraping toolkit that leverages Ollama, BrightData, Selenium, and other modern libraries to intelligently extract data from the web. Designed for efficiency and scalability, it combines traditional scraping techniques with LLM-assisted decision-making to navigate complex sites, bypass anti-bot measures, and parse data in a structured, adaptable format.

Key Features:

🤖 AI-Assisted Scraping using Ollama to understand context, interpret page structures, and guide scraping logic dynamically.

🌐 BrightData Integration for robust proxy management and geo-targeted scraping.

🕸️ Selenium Automation for interacting with JavaScript-heavy or dynamic content.

🧠 Intelligent retry logic, headless browsing, and customizable workflows.

📦 Modular architecture that makes it easy to plug in new targets, extractors, or AI models.
